## Getting Started

**Are there any potential issues for scaling the prototype beyond a subset of users? Examples: reliance on a single server to handle the demand, coded for a specific platform**

Issues that would arise would be the need for more server space and ensuring our platform runs as efficiently as possible when creating content, as we expanded there would be more processing required. Also we would need more developers to constantly monitor the system and make it more efficient. We will need to look into security protocols as well if we begin to store much more data

**If the data is sensitive, is it stored in the proper locations?**

Yes, those credentials are not shared in the repository.


**Does the app collect analytics on user behaviour to help improve the UX?**

No, it doesn’t currently but that is a path we were looking at. We are looking to have ad revenue as our main source so collecting analytics will help improve the UX and also our ads.


**Deployed to a URL if a web app, or test devices provided if it is a platform-specific app? Note: the whole app needs to be deployed not only the landing page/s**

Yes, we have included our entire prototype in the single website link given above as Live URL.


**Does something interesting – for ex., mockup available, machine learning, data aggregation/visualization, IR techniques (anything you think may qualify as an extra feature)**

Yes, we have a feature that compares 3 different companies prices within our application as well as providing a blog page for reviews and feedback within the website.

**Our full application is deployed and tested well. However, feedback is always appreciated.**
