                		We make it possible for customers to compare the pricing of their orders among several delivery services. The user will utilise a search menu to look for either a menu item, a restaurant, or a location. After adding things to the cart, the user will see and compare the final checkout pricing of food items on various delivery services. The user may then choose the cheapest option and finalise the order by being sent to that delivery service using the information they saved on the FoodFeed platform.

                	<p>
                		With so many delivery options, how do you ensure you're getting the best deal when you order delivery? Currently, a user needs to perform the same steps on each delivery platform to compare the pricing of his order, but FoodFeed allows this to be done on a single platform with no effort. It prevents customers from becoming frustrated and overspending, allowing them to compare prices across sites.

                		<b>FoodBoss</b> is a service that allows customers to compare their orders based on delivery costs and time, although it is centred in the United States.
						<b>MealMe</b> just compares order delivery prices. 
						In Canada, we are giving an efficient alternative to their existing system. People can save time and money by using a user-friendly interface and experience.

                	<p>
                		On FoodFeed, users may register, compare, and complete orders with payment. This solution will utilize web scraping, which aggregates data from many sources and displays it for the user's convenience in a single area for comparison. We will gather and compare the sum of the menu item costs, taxes, surcharges, delivery fees, and commissions.
